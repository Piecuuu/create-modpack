Here's a quite nice modpack I've built for my server.

If your mod is included in this pack and you would like to be credited in this `README.md` file, please open an issue or a pull request. I apologise for not crediting everyone here right away, but the modpack is very large and that would mean visiting every project's page and manually adding them here.

Thanks to:
